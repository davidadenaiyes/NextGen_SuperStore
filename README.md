![Data Analyst]()

## Introduction
NextGen emporium is an online retail store that seeks insights from its data for informed business decisions. However, they recently observed that they do not have adequate data insights to answer pressing business issues on sales improvement.

## Problem Statement
NextGen, an  e-commerce company wants to optimize its online sales by analyzing its sales data and customer behavior to improve its product offerings and marketing strategies. I split the analysis into 3 major categories. **_Sales Performance, Customer Insights & Product Performance_**

### Sales Performance:  
- How are sales trending over time?
- What are the peak sales months/seasons?
- How do sales vary across different product categories?
- **Metric:** Monthly/Yearly Sales Growth

### Customer Insights: 
- Who are our top customers in terms of purchasing frequency and spending?
- What is the average customer lifetime value?
- How can we segment our customers based on their purchasing behavior?
- **Metrics:** Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), Purchase Frequency

### Product Performance: 
- Which products are the top sellers in terms of revenue?
- Are there any products with consistently low sales? How can we improve their performance?
- How do products spread across the world?


## Skills and Concepts demonstrated 

For this project I will be using **_Tableau_** to clean my dataset,  run my hypothesis and finally plotting my analysis on visualization.
